What is network?

The computers on a network may be linked through cables, telephone lines, radio waves, satellites, or infrared light beams.

 - DNS, or the Domain Name System, translates human readable domain names (for example, www.amazon.com) to machine readable IP addresses (for example, 192.0.2.44).
