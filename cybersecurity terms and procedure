To find  network vulnerabilities
Ascade-password cracking tool
bruteforce
RAT-remote access trorzan
data and resource,securing,security,safeguarding
physical control and administrative control,logical control  theses are the security controls
pord scanning
protocol is the set of rules
TCP port-65,535 ports is the total ports 
UDP port-65,535 is the additional port.... 1,31,070 total ports jointed of the TCP,UDP.tcp is used wide range.
http port 80 is the website is unsafe
htpps port 443-SECURE SOCKET LAYER
differnce of http and https
blockchain
exploid-sql injunction
section hijacking
phising
IP address
cloud ,DNS
spoofing
hashing,meta sploite
backdoor
ethical hacker-a process of detecting vulnerabilities in an application, system, or organization's infrastructure that an attacker can use to exploit an individual or organization.
webserver,website and web applications,webpages  differnace
web application security testing and  the peneration testing.
offensive(red team) and the defensive(blue team)(SOC ANALYST,MALWARE ANALYST)-two fields
three types of the hackers
1.white hat
2.black hat
3.grey hat.
CIA STANDS FOR THE confidenitialy,intergity,avalibility-these are the network security
auterincation another one name access control
three factors only as the-->verify identity,biometrics,physical proof(aadhar card,pan card,voter id of a particular person)
ENCRYPTION-clear text to cyber text.
Breach-the loss of control
Event-Any observable occurance in a network or system
Expliot-A particular attack.
Incident-An event  that actually or potienally jeopardizes the confidentally,integrity or avalibilty.
Intrusion-A security event,or combination of events.It is IETF RFC 4949 Ver 2.
Threat-Any circumstance or event with the operations
VULNERBILITY-weakness is a information system security procedures.IT IS THE NIST SP 800-30 rev 1.
Zero Day-A previously unknown System vulnerability with the potiential of exploitation without risks
TOE-target of evaluation
Ipv6-128b-hex-0-9,A,B,C,D,E,F
differnce of IPV4 and the IPv6
192.168.1.0-192.168.1.255-->256 IPs
ipconfig
nv path=> pre defined commands to give in cmd
cross over=> connect same network devices
straight through=> connect different network
serialDTE=>to connect two router
packet tracking tool--->to lostern the
icmp-->internet conrol message protocol
DHCP---->default  IP
Tracert-----> give ip address



ERROR__________________
desination host if it comees it error ---->cisco packet tracer 
timeout error-->in cisco packet tracer if it comes means it has error speeling of name or the ip address wrong...



COMMANDS
===========================================================
ipconfig=> to get my id address
ping --help=> to display help command
(WIN)ping (ipaddress) -n (no.of req)=> to send n no of request
(Linux) ping (ipaddress) -v (no.of req)=> to send n no of request

POWERSHELL COMMANDS=======================================================================
where (file name)=> to find the location of the application
cat (file name) (WIN)/more(Linux)=> to read the file
