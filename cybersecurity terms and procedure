TERMS=====================================================================
To find  network vulnerabilities
Ascade-password cracking tool
bruteforce
RAT-remote access trorzan
data and resource,securing,security,safeguarding
physical control and administrative control,logical control  theses are the security controls
pord scanning
protocol is the set of rules
TCP port-65,535 ports is the total ports 
UDP port-65,535 is the additional port.... 1,31,070 total ports jointed of the TCP,UDP.tcp is used wide range.
http port 80 is the website is unsafe
htpps port 443-SECURE SOCKET LAYER
differnce of http and https
blockchain
exploid-sql injunction
section hijacking
phising
IP address
cloud ,DNS
spoofing
hashing,meta sploite
backdoor
ethical hacker-a process of detecting vulnerabilities in an application, system, or organization's infrastructure that an attacker can use to exploit an individual or organization.
webserver,website and web applications,webpages  differnace
web application security testing and  the peneration testing.
offensive(red team) and the defensive(blue team)(SOC ANALYST,MALWARE ANALYST)-two fields
three types of the hackers
1.white hat
2.black hat
3.grey hat.
CIA STANDS FOR THE confidenitialy,intergity,avalibility-these are the network security
auterincation another one name access control
three factors only as the-->verify identity,biometrics,physical proof(aadhar card,pan card,voter id of a particular person)
ENCRYPTION-clear text to cyber text.
Breach-the loss of control
Event-Any observable occurance in a network or system
Expliot-A particular attack.
Incident-An event  that actually or potienally jeopardizes the confidentally,integrity or avalibilty.
Intrusion-A security event,or combination of events.It is IETF RFC 4949 Ver 2.
Threat-Any circumstance or event with the operations
VULNERBILITY-weakness is a information system security procedures.IT IS THE NIST SP 800-30 rev 1.
Zero Day-A previously unknown System vulnerability with the potiential of exploitation without risks
TOE-target of evaluation
Ipv6-128b-hex-0-9,A,B,C,D,E,F
differnce of IPV4 and the IPv6
192.168.1.0-192.168.1.255-->256 IPs
ipconfig
nv path=> pre defined commands to give in cmd
cross over=> connect same network devices
straight through=> connect different network
serialDTE=>to connect two router
packet tracking tool--->to lostern the
icmp-->internet conrol message protocol
DHCP---->default  IP
Tracert-----> give ip address
SOC-->Security operations center (ROLE OF IT IN CYBERSECURITY ONE DOMAIN)
LO---->loop back internet interface
w lan--->wireless Lan
etho-->Ether net
proxy---> an individual, legally allowed to act on behalf of another party or a format that would allow a participant to vote without being physically present at the meeting.
VPN-->Encryption/Decryption the connection between the client and the server.
ENCRYPTION : clear text to cyber text
DECRYPTION : cyber text to clear text.
Bruteforceattack---->it combines to check to all the combination of the all the virus format.!
Dictionaryattack--->it checks only the one of the combination to check to compare your password to the others if same it will be the hacked..!
SUCCESS CODE---->200
staring of 5------->SERVER SIDE............
USER AGENT---> it calls the browser


CLIENT-->  BURP PROXY-->SERVER
evertimes it will goes proxy and then only go to others 


TOR- BITCOIN 1b- $67000


CLIENT--->PROXY 1-->PROXY 2--->PROXY 3 --> PROXY  4-->PROXY  5 --->PROXY 6 ---->Server
 

IMPORTANT INTERFACE BETWEEN  BETWEEN CLIENT TO SERVER MUST REMAINS ..!!
INTERVIEW IMPORTANT QUESTION IN DEVELOPING SIDE AND ALSO HERE : NOTE
===============================
client request----->   server response---->DB
HTTP METHODS              RESPONSE CODE
GET                          1XX--Informational
POST                          2xx-OK
PUT                           3xx-Redirection
OPTIONS                       4xx-Client-side error
DELETE                        5x--Server-side error

MUST KNOW..........!!!!!!!!!!!
=============
HTTP(METHODS)
GET
POST
PUT
OPTIONS
DELETE

What is a Pua?===========================================================
Potentially unwanted application or applications (PUAs), classified as grayware, refer to applications installed in a mobile device or a computer that may pose high risk or have untoward impact on user security and/or privacy.



FIND WEBSITE NAME TO IP ADDRESS====
COMMAND============
put as the command prompt 
website name  -c  4(4 indicates as the packet)
then you go to wireshark  and given as  the ip.addr== the ip address of the website

TOOLS===================================================================
wireshark--->packet analysis tool
VIRUSTOTAL---> for the pupose of hash value checking and also checking the Antivirus  checking.
BURP SUITE ---->  it is the tool must  know it ...

BURP SUITE DEFAULT IP  PORT  ADDRESS=============================================
8080

IMPORTANT COMMANDS FOR CMD============
NOTE :IT ONLY RUNS IN KALI  OS
sudo--->do as a super user(full form)
sudo nmcli networking on :
sudo service NetworkingManger Start :



INTERVIEW QUESTIONS :(IMPORTANT)
==============================================================
Symmetric Encrp -single key
Asymmetric Encrp -Public/private key
what is Three way handshake ?-----they all done in the tcp protocols 
1.SYN
2.SYN-ACK
3.ACK
TLS(transport layer security)-HANDSHAKE.
differnce of the Encryption and Hashing.




ERROR__________________
desination host if it comees it error ---->cisco packet tracer 
timeout error-->in cisco packet tracer if it comes means it has error speeling of name or the ip address wrong...



COMMANDS
===========================================================
ipconfig=> to get my id address
ping --help=> to display help command
(WIN)ping (ipaddress) -n (no.of req)=> to send n no of request
(Linux) ping (ipaddress) -v (no.of req)=> to send n no of request

POWERSHELL COMMANDS=======================================================================
where (file name)=> to find the location of the application
cat (file name) (WIN)/more(Linux)=> to read the file
echo "hai" >(filename)=>to insert the text in file
echo "hai" >>(filename)=>to append the text in file
mkdir (folder name)=> make directory
mv (filename) (folder name)=> to cut paste
cp (filename) (folder name)=> to copy paste
python -m http.server 80=>to run server. 80 is port name
 Get-fileHash ----->  Get-filehash. filepath(IT HAS THE CHECKS THE file is secured or not )

Example :
Get-fileHash '.\kali-Linux-2023.4-vmware-amd64.7z'
