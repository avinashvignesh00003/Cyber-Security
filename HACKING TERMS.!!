THE 5 PHASES OF THE  HACKS.!!!!!!  
5 ------PHASES OF THE HACKING--------------------
1.INFORMATION GATHERING
2.THERAT MODELING
3.VULNERABILITY ANANLYSIS
4.EXPLOITATION-MAINITAIN ACCESS ALSO CALLED PERSISIST
5.POST EXPLOITATION-CLEARING TRACTS

=================this is command which is used in kali linux command prompt to install to anything===================
sudo apt install apache2
NOTE : apche2 has the name given which we want to the download 

===================NOTE========================:
CMSS-CONTACT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
(IT IS NO NEED CODING  WITHOUT CODING TO BUILD STATIC WEBSITE) BY USE DRAG AND DROP

SPYDER------>IT DOWNLOADS AUTOMATICALLY ENTIRE AND CHECKS THE WEBSITE AND HAVE ANY VULNERABILITIES IT IS EASY TO SCAMMED YOUR WEBSITES BY  THE ATTACKERS. ....!

===================================TOOLS==================
ZEPROXY---->checking for the vulnearbilities in the website .
NESSUS---->It is also checking the vulnearbilities for the website.
WPSCAN--->TO SCAN WORD PRESS


=============== (OWASP)  --> it is website to know the  top 10 most websites vulnearbilites (NOTE : MUST KNOW)==================

====================DIRECTORY TRAVSEL AND THE (ALSO CALLEAD AS THE PATH TRAVSEL)  IT IS THE IMPORTANT VULNERABILITY===========

=========EVERY LINUX MUST HAVE THIS  FILE================== 
put this command : cat  /etc/passwd
   
=============windows must have the win.ini=================
use command as the---------------> ../../../../windows.win

===================================TOOL=================
cyberchef------->it is used for the check png and thee file to small size....


========================maximum working depends upon the======================
REPEPEATER ONLY
NOT INTRUDER

======commands======================
ping facebook.com -c  4 | grep 163

=====MUST KNOW THIS  SHELL  AND ALSO ASK  ABOUT THIS SHELLS IN INTERVIEW QUESTIONS======================= 
web shell------>brower
bind shell-------------->process/service/port combine 
reverse shell---------->USER  INTERACTION
  website name : revshell.com
===================tools if the system has been hacked  we use to check it.!!!=========================
process explorer
TCPVIEW

ghpsheel ----> it will be the  hacking entire the  system......

canarytokens---->it is the website to hack the cookies..................

ANGRYIPSCANNER------------>ITS SCANNING THE IP ADDRESS....
IN KALI WE USED ----------> NETDISCOVER TOOL FOR THE SCAN THE IP ADDRESS

- Hub runs with ip address so it send packet to all the pcs which are all connected to the hub.
Switch:
-Switch runs with both MAC address and Ip address.SO it can able to send another switch with same ip address of the pcs.

3.starter group policy object.

NOTE:
AUTERITICATION MECHANISHM------->MAJOR REASON TO HAPPEND HACKING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!.

wifite------------>it is the tool used by all to hack  wifi passwords 
netsh wlan show profile----> to check which are the devies are in connected by you in hotspot..!
