SPYDER------>IT DOWNLOADS AUTOMATICALLY ENTIRE AND CHECKS THE WEBSITE AND HAVE ANY VULNERABILITIES IT IS EASY TO SCAMMED YOUR WEBSITES BY  THE ATTACKERS. ....!

===================================TOOLS==================
ZEPROXY---->checking for the vulnearbilities in the website .
NESSUS---->It is also checking the vulnearbilities for the website.
WPSCAN--->TO SCAN WORD PRESS


=============== (OWASP)  --> it is website to know the  top 10 most websites vulnearbilites (NOTE : MUST KNOW)==================

====================DIRECTORY TRAVSEL AND THE (ALSO CALLEAD AS THE PATH TRAVSEL)  IT IS THE IMPORTANT VULNERABILITY===========
